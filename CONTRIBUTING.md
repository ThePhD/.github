## Reporting Issues

If you found a bug, please make sure to make an issue in the issue tracker.

The guidelines for reporting a bug are relatively simple and are as follows:

1. If possible, produce a simple, short, compile-able test case that reproduces your problem.
2. Make a descriptive title that summarizes the bug as a whole.
3. Explain the bug in as much detail as you can in the body of the issue.
4. Include as many details as you possibly can.

If you have all of those requirements set, then your issue reporting is golden!



## Submitting a pull request

Submitting a pull request is fairly simple, just make sure it focuses on a single aspect and doesn't manage to have scope creep and it's probably good to go. It would be incredibly lovely if the style is consistent to those found in the repository, using any automatic-formatters provided!

If you don't meet all of these style guidelines, don't fret. We'll probably fix it. But please do make an effort to actually meet them. Otherwise we're more likely to reject the pull request or ask for changes.
